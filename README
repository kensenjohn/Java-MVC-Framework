This is a simple MVC framework which can be used to build web application in a quick manner.
This has been tested with tomcat 5.5 and tomcat 6 only. 


Changes to web.xml (placed in WEB-INF)
1) Add the StartupServlet.java as servlet.
2) Add a Filter which will only intercepts form requests with the actions which ends with ".go"
     Make change in web.xml to allow or add other extensions.


control.xml
This xml holds information for every action. It will specify every InitProcessor, Service, Dispatcher.
Based on the result status, it will also provide information to the jsps where the response to be redirected to.

StartupServlet.java
This is loaded on startup. It converts all nodes in control.xml into a hashmap and stores it as a hashmap in the ServletContext for quick access.

If a request to a jsp is made, the Filter will not intercept it.
If the action is changed to ".go" the Filter will redirect it to the ControlServlet.

ControlServlet.java
This will use the action name in the request to identify a node in the control.xml from the SErvletContext.
It uses this information to invoke the init processor, service, and dispatcher.

See comments in the java files to understand the functioning better.

Call to jsps direclty are not processed by the Controller.
